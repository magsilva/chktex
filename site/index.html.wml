<topic "ChkTeX">
 <p>
  This is an homepage for ChkTeX, for a long time now it didn't have any home and
  it needed one in order to have a center place for development.
 </p>
 <p>
  I (Baruch Even) am the Debian maintainer for the ChkTeX package, and since the
  program author is missing, I fixed some bugs and maintained it to the best of
  ability. However Debian is not the only distribution and others are interested
  in this program so I setup this place to allow for a central place to get
  updates and provide patches.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am unlikely to continue development on ChkTeX, I'll mostly do bug fixes. If
  anyone is interested in stepping up and improve ChkTeX further it will be
  appreciated.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Actual development happens in a Subversion repository.
  Anonymous checkout can be done with the command:
  <tt>svn co svn://svn.ev-en.org/chktex/trunk/chktex</tt>
 </p> 
 
 <ul>
  <li><a href="http://svn.ev-en.org/?project=chktex">Subversion repository</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/chktex/">Savannah project</a></li>
 </ul>
 
<p>
The latest version is:
</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="chktex-1.6.3.tar.gz">1.6.3</a>
     -
	 <a href="chktex-1.6.3.tar.gz.sig">GPG Signature</a>

   This program has been written in frustration because some constructs
   in LaTeX are sometimes non-intuitive, and easy to forget. It is _not_
   a replacement for the built-in checker in LaTeX; however it catches
   some typographic errors LaTeX oversees. In other words, it is Lint for
   LaTeX. Filters are also provided for checking the LaTeX parts of CWEB
   documents.
  </p>
  <p>
   The program also supports output formats suitable for further
   processing by editors or other programs, making errors easy to cycle
   through. Software is provided for beautifully interfacing against the
   AUC-TeX Emacs mode. It is known to interface with
   <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>.

   ChkTeX begins to get quite a few bells and whistles now. However, you
   should be aware of that in most cases, all this is transparent to the
   user. As you will see, ChkTeX offers the ability to adapt to many
   environments and configurations.

     * Supports over 40 warnings. Warnings include:
          + Commands terminated with space. Ignores ``\tt'', etc.
          + Space in front of references instead of ``~''.
          + Forgetting to group parenthesis characters when
            sub-/superscripting.
          + Italic correction (``\/'') mistakes (double, missing,
            unnecessary).
          + Parenthesis and environment matching.
          + Ellipsis detection; also checks whether to use ``\dots'',
            ``\cdots'' or ``\ldots''.
          + Enforcement of normal space after abbreviation. Detects most
            abbreviations automagically.
          + Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence
            ended with capital letter.
          + Math-mode on/off detection.
          + Quote checking, both wrong types (``"'') and wrong direction.
          + Recommends splitting three quotes in a row.
          + Searching for user patterns.
          + Displays comments.
          + Space in front of ``\label'' and similar commands.
          + Use of ``x'' instead of ``$\times$'' between numbers.
          + Multiple spaces in input which will be rendered as one space
            (or multiple spaces, where that is undesirable).
          + Warns about text which may be ignored.
          + Mathematical operators typeset as variables.
          + No space in front of/after parenthesis.
          + Demands a consistent quote style.
          + Punctuation inside inner math mode/outside display math mode.
          + Use of TeX primitives where LaTeX equivalents are available.
          + Space in front of footnotes.
          + Bogus characters following commands.
     * Fully customizable. Intelligent resource format makes it possible
       to make ChkTeX respect your LaTeX setup. Even command-line options
       may be specified globally in the ``chktexrc'' file.
     * Supports ``\input'' command; both TeX and LaTeX version. Actually
       includes the files. ``TEXINPUTS''-equivalent search path.
     * Intelligent warning/error handling. The user may promote/mute
       warnings to suit his preferences. You may also mute warnings in
       the header of a file; thus killing much unwanted garbage.
     * Scripts included for checking CWEB files written in LaTeX.
       (Requires perl v5).
     * Supports both LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.
     * Flexible output handling. Has some predefined formats and lets the
       user specify his own format. Uses a ``printf()'' similar syntax.
       ``lacheck'' compatible mode included for interfacing with the
       AUC-TeX Emacs mode.
     * ARexx scripts for interfacing with ScMsg and VBrowse are included.
       Special scripts included for CygnusED/GoldED, for binding to
       hotkey.
     * Amiga Workbench support. Parameters may be passed by
       shift-clicking the LaTeX files and setting the remaining options
       in the tooltypes.
     * Wildcard matching (Amiga only). Matches file patterns internally,
       thus saving a lot of work. This is, however, platform-specific
       code -- on UNIX boxes this is done by the shell.
     * Written in ANSI C. ``configure'' script included for easy setup
       and installation on UNIX systems.

  <p>
   Still, it is important to realize that the output from ChkTeX is only
   intended as a _guide_ to fixing faults. However, it is by no means
   always correct. This means that correct LaTeX code may produce errors
   in ChkTeX, and vice versa: Incorrect LaTeX code may pass silently
   through.
